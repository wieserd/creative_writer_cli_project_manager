**Development Plan: Resolve Duplicate File Entries**

**1. Confirm File Duplication:**
    *   Verify the physical existence of `json_store.py` and `project_repository.py` in both `/src/creative_writer_cli/data/` and `/src/creative_writer_cli/data/repositories/`. (Already confirmed via `list_directory` output).

**2. Analyze File Content for Differences:**
    *   Read the content of `json_store.py` from both `/src/creative_writer_cli/data/json_store.py` and `/src/creative_writer_cli/data/repositories/json_store.py`.
    *   Read the content of `project_repository.py` from both `/src/creative_writer_cli/data/project_repository.py` and `/src/creative_writer_cli/data/repositories/project_repository.py`.
    *   Compare the contents to determine if they are identical.

**3. Trace File Usage (Imports):**
    *   Search the entire `src/creative_writer_cli/` directory for import statements related to `json_store` and `project_repository`.
    *   Identify which specific paths are being imported (e.g., `from creative_writer_cli.data import json_store` vs. `from creative_writer_cli.data.repositories import json_store`). This will reveal which set of files (if any) is actively being used by the application.

**4. Determine Root Cause and Solution:**
    *   **Scenario A: Files are identical and only one path is imported.** This indicates a redundant copy. The solution will be to delete the unused duplicate files and update the `README.md`.
    *   **Scenario B: Files are identical but both paths are imported.** This indicates a misconfiguration or redundant imports. The solution will be to consolidate imports to a single path, delete the redundant files, and update the `README.md`.
    *   **Scenario C: Files are different.** This would be highly unusual for files with the same name and similar apparent function. If this is the case, I will need to analyze the differences and their implications before proposing a solution. (Less likely, but important to check).

**5. Implement Solution (if applicable):**
    *   If redundant files are identified, use `run_shell_command` to safely remove them.
    *   If import paths need to be updated, use `replace` to modify the relevant files.

**6. Update `README.md`:**
    *   Once the actual file system and code structure are corrected, update the `README.md` to accurately reflect the non-duplicated project structure.
